Human cloning 'flawed'Human cloning may never be possible because of a quirk of biology.Something goes wrong as the cell divides (Science) Scientists in the United States say hundreds of attempts to clone monkeys have ended in failure. They think the biological make-up of the eggs of primates, including humans, makes cloning almost impossible. Cloning has been successful in several mammals, including sheep, mice and cattle, but there is increasing evidence that it does not work in all species. The research, reported in the journal Science, casts further doubt on efforts by a handful of mavericks to clone humans. Clonaid, a company created by a UFO cult known as the Raelians, claims to have already cloned several babies. It has produced no evidence to substantiate these claims. Meanwhile, controversial reproductive scientist Panayiotis Zavos has published a picture of what he claims is "the first human cloned embryo for reproductive purposes". Misguided science The majority of scientists agree that attempts to clone a human baby are dangerous and misguided. Many cloned animals have been born ill or deformed and successful births are few and far between. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine used the method pioneered on Dolly the sheep to try to clone rhesus macaque monkeys. They were unable to establish a single pregnancy after hundreds of attempts. Other groups have also tried and failed to clone monkeys. The obstacle appears to be something to do with the way genetic material is parcelled up as a cell splits into two during embryonic development. Cells end up with too much, or too little DNA, and cannot survive. It suggests that attempts to clone other primates, even humans, may be doomed to failure. "This reinforces the fact that the charlatans who claim to have cloned humans have never understood enough cell or developmental biology (to succeed)," team leader Dr Gerald Schatten told the journal Science. Company shows 'cloned baby' A company claiming to have created the world's first cloned babies has distributed a photograph of one of the "clones" for the first time. Previous promises of DNA proof were not followed upClonaid said a picture of an infant in an incubator published on its website showed the third of five babies supposedly cloned since December. Many scientists have dismissed Clonaid's claim that any babies were ever cloned at all, pointing to the absence of DNA proof. But the company, which is linked to a sect maintaining that humans were created by aliens, insists the picture shows "the third clone baby", allegedly born in Japan. Its president, Brigitte Boisselier, handed out copies of the photograph on Monday on a visit to Brazil to promote the company. The Raelians believe mankind is descended from aliens Ms Boisselier, who is also a "bishop" of the Raelian sect, promised to present evidence in the next few days that the child was indeed cloned. The baby's father, she said, would soon travel to Brazil to offer scientists proof that the baby's DNA was identical to that of a deceased sibling. Accompanying Ms Boisselier is Raelian founder and leader Claude Vorilhon, known as Rael. Clonaid says that five babies have been cloned and are all doing well: Eve, the first, was allegedly born to US parents on Boxing Day A second cloned baby girl is said to have been born to a Dutch lesbian on 3 January with a third, a boy, allegedly born in Japan later that month A fourth "cloned baby" was born to Saudi Arabian parents on 27 January, Clonaid says, and a fifth on 4 February. Dolly goes on display Dolly will go on public display on 11 April The world's first cloned mammal is to be placed on public display at the Royal Museum in Edinburgh. Dolly the sheep, who died two months ago, has been preserved and is set to take centre stage in the museum's Science Zone later this week. She will go on to become a permanent feature at the museum later this year. Dolly was born on 5 July 1996 but the decision was taken to euthanase her after a veterinary examination showed that she had a progressive lung disease. The six-year-old had been created by the Roslin Institute research centre near Edinburgh. Key role It has now been announced that Dolly will go on display at the city's Royal Museum between 11 and 22 April. She will play a key role in the Science Zone, a series of events and workshops running in parallel with the Edinburgh International Science Festival. National Museums of Scotland (NMS) director Dr Gordon Rintoul said: "Dolly is a striking reminder of Scotland's record of scientific achievement and her contribution can now be recognised for many centuries to come. She will go on reminding people of the fact that scientific progress was made in Edinburgh which is making people think very differently about this aspect of biology Dr Ian Wilmot "She will prove an important focus for future new science displays in the Royal Museum." Dolly was donated to the NMS by the Roslin Institute after she died in February this year. Dr Ian Wilmot, who led the cloning team, said his pride at seeing her on display was tinged with sadness. "It's not so many weeks since she was alive and in the barn but we're very proud that's she in here," he said. "She will go on reminding people of the fact that scientific progress was made in Edinburgh which is making people think very differently about this aspect of biology. "It's stimulating people to do research which one day will help to provide cells needed to treat very unpleasant human diseases." Dolly will be joining the NMS collections alongside Morag, who has been on display in the Royal Museum since November 2000. Dolly will be joining earlier clone Morag The cloning of Morag from an embryo cell in a laboratory by the Roslin Institute later led to the cloning of Dolly from an adult cell.  Stockmen involved in Dolly's delivery were inspired by the fact that the cell used came from a mammary gland and named her after Dolly Parton, the country and western singer.  She will accompany a display marking the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the structure of DNA by James Watson and Frances Crick.  The Science Zone is organised by the NMS and the University of Edinburgh.  Dolly will be transferred to the Museum of Scottish Life in East Kilbride in July. In September, she will return to the Royal Museum as a permanent exhibit.
